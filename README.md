# CheeseCounter
Little software to help people count weight in packaking stage.


When i was working fulltime in Herkkutilan Oy "cheese factory", i created
this software to help keep count of packages and weights.
In busy times i found extremely helpful, especially if you were
working alone. It was easy to keep up what you have counted.

It is in finnish, since everybody who worked with special cheeses
were finnish and it was made one use purpose only.

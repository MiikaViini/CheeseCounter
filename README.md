# CheeseCounter
Little software to help people count weight in packaking stage.
!NOTE!
I didn't feel that it would be necessary to upload all Visual Studio 
related files, so i provide you code that i created and executable.
If you want all files, you can contact me via Linkedin

When i was working fulltime in Herkkutilan Oy "cheese factory", i created
this software to help keep count of packages and weights.
In busy times i found extremely helpful, especially if you were
working alone. It was easy to keep up what you have counted.

It is in finnish, since everybody who worked with special cheeses
were finnish and it was made one use purpose only.

USAGE

Obviously there is date top left corner, which updates automatically.
The most right box is for warehouse workers to notice that these 
cheese are ready to be taken to warehouse.

`Valitse juusto`, you can manually choose the cheese or it will be
automatically choosen when EAN -code feeded. Top most center box is
for that. You can use manual feeding or device.

`Kokonaispaino` will tell you how much all of that cheese is weighting.
`Laatikot` tells how many boxes of cheese if packed.
`TransBox` tells you how many Transbox you have packed. Default is allways 1.
Transbox will take certain amount of "Laatikot" then updates.

`Manuaalinen syotto` will give you chanche to feed all box info manually.

`Tyhjenna lista` will empty the list
Image with printer will open printing preference window and you can print
info what have been feeded and calculated. This is for warehouse workers.

As this is my very first software and was created to serve one purpose only,
the code is messy and program may have bugs.

Use it at your own risk!!!
